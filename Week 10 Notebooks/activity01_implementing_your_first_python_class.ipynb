        "- By the end of this activity, you will be able to design and implement a basic class in Python.\n",
        "- Understand the fundamental principles of object-oriented programming and how they can be applied to solve real-world problems.\n",

        "\n",
        "## Introduction\n",
        "Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a fundamental programming paradigm used across many programming languages, including Python. It allows developers to organise software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. Understanding how to implement your first Python class will not only help in structuring code more efficiently but also in real-world applications like software development and data management.\n",

        "### Using AI Tools Ethically & Effectively\n",
        "> **Transparency:** Always acknowledge when and how you've used AI in your work. If AI helps you to brainstorm or refine ideas, add a note explaining this use.\n",
        ">\n",
        "> **Critical Evaluation:** Remember that AI-generated suggestions might not always be correct. Always verify facts and logic and refine the AI's suggestions.\n",
        ">\n",
        "> **Learning Partner:** Utilise AI as a learning tool. Ask for explanations or examples to better understand concepts, e.g., \"Explain encapsulation in simple terms\" or \"Give me an example of a class in Python.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "## Key Concepts\n",
        "- **Class:** A blueprint for creating objects (a particular data structure), providing initial values for state (member variables) and implementations of behavior (member functions or methods).\n",
        "- **Object:** An instance of a class.\n",
        "- **Attribute:** A characteristic of an object (usually variables).\n",
        "- **Method:** A function that is associated with an object.\n",

        "## Learning Objectives\n",
        "- By the end of this activity, you will be able to distinguish between procedural and object-oriented programming in Python.\n",
        "- Understand the basic concepts and applications of classes and objects.\n",
        "- Evaluate the appropriateness of using procedural or object-oriented techniques for different programming scenarios.\n",

        "## Introduction\n",
        "Understanding different programming paradigms is crucial not only for developing flexible coding skills but also for appreciating how these paradigms can be applied to solve various problems efficiently. This worksheet will guide you through the foundational concepts of Procedural and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python, helping you see where each approach might be most effective.\n",

        "## Key Concepts\n",
        "- **Procedural Programming:** A programming paradigm based on the concept of procedure calls, where statements are structured into procedures (functions).\n",
        "- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** A programming paradigm based on the concept of \"objects\", which can contain data in the form of fields (often known as attributes), and code, in the form of procedures (often known as methods).\n",
        "- **Class:** A blueprint for creating objects (a particular data structure), providing initial values for state (member variables), and implementations of behavior (member functions or methods).\n",
